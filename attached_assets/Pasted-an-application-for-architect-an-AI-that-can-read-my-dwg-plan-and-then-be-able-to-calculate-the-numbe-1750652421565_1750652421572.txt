an application for architect an AI that can read my dwg plan and then be able to calculate the number of places with the data we provide to know how many boxes I can involve

Do you want the application to also read the dimensions of the room from PDF plans, or will you also provide DWG files for geometry extraction?

Ans = Yes, he must take all this into account, there will be common areas on the plans, the sound of island boxes, that is to say small houses, it is to calculate the space of the plan and know how many islands I can put in real life in real size

What kind of "boxes" are you referring to? Are these standard-sized storage units, furniture or something else?

Ans = yes the size is standard and can be modified if necessary by the user

Should AI take into account specific constraints (e.g., access paths, structural elements, preferred part types) when placing these boxes?

Ans = yes she will have to know how to read the plan and use an algorithm that can make sure to read the plan as we see it in real life and that can place the boxes accordingly without any overlap

What release are you expecting: a visual placement, a report or both?

Years = a visual placement and with a pdf extraction

Do you already have the known dimensions of the boxes (length × width × height)?

Years = for the moment ulilison give randomly to see what it gives
Copilot said: Here’s a **requirements summary** for your final


Functional Requirements
1. Input Support
Plan File Types:
The app must accept both DWG and PDF floor plans.
For DWG: Extract room geometry and dimensions directly.
For PDF: Extract room geometry and dimensions if possible, or prompt user for manual input if automated extraction fails.
User Inputs:
Users can specify the standard box (“island”) dimensions (length, width, height). Defaults are provided but can be changed.
2. AI/Algorithmic Processing
Plan Analysis:
The AI reads and parses the uploaded plan, recognizing:
Room boundaries and dimensions.
Common/shared areas.
Obstacles: structural elements (columns, beams, stairs), HVAC, doors, etc.
Access paths/corridors and required clearances.
Box Placement Algorithm:
Calculates all feasible placements for the “boxes” (islands) within the plan.
Considers:
No overlap between boxes or with obstacles.
Access paths and circulation space (user-defined minimum clearances).
Boxes must fit inside rooms and common areas.
User can specify or adjust the box size at any time.
Algorithm simulates real-life placement, maximizing the number of boxes per space.
Result Calculation:
Reports the maximum number of boxes per room and for the entire plan.
Provides a breakdown by room and by box type (if types/divisions are added in the future).
3. Visualization & Reporting
Visual Output:
Renders a visual overlay of the floor plan with all box placements shown (SVG or Canvas).
Highlights room boundaries, obstacles, and access paths.
Export/Report:
Generates a downloadable PDF report summarizing:
Plan analysis.
Number and location of boxes.
Room-by-room breakdown.
Warnings about constrained or inaccessible rooms.
(Optional/future) Export placements as a CAD-compatible format.
4. Usability
Interactive UI:
Users can upload a plan, adjust box size, and set clearances.
See live visual feedback and results after every change.
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
Should handle large, complex plans efficiently (reasonable processing time).
Extensibility:
Designed so new box types, room types, or placement rules can be added.
Accuracy:
Plan reading (especially from DWG) should be robust; fallback options for PDF/manual input.
